# WorldCup allows to choose a first, second, and third place from a set of "teams", using
# a format inspired by FIFA(R) World Cup's mechanics.
# For full details, visit https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FIFA_World_Cup
# In essence, it will first divide participants in groups of 4, which will compete against each other,
# obtaining points for each win or tie.
# Half of the group will move forward to the Knockout stage.
# In the first game of the knockout stage, each group winner will face a second-place from a different group.
# On this and all next rounds there are no ties; ties get solved through a round of 5 penalty kicks, and if not, 
# sudden death (first unmatched score wins).
# In order for this to work, the number of teams has to be a power of 2 greater than 8. The game will introduce virtual players
# until this condition is satisfied. This means that it's possible that the game is won by a virtual player. In this case, it's
# necessary to re-run the game.
